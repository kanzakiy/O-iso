Memo

Use -GS.f files to calculate coefficients reflecting forcing factors
dsw.f file calculates dynamic and steady state simulations 

Fig7-9 are made using a result from sensitivity analysis.

Sensitivity analysis is made using -GS-sense.f files
Then seawater is calculated by dsw_sense.f file
Seawater transitions are reflected by -GS-res-ser-sense.f files
